After two years since we have visiting our favorite place, we decided to fly back to Bangkok for a second time! We not only explored areas of Thailand that we didn't see the first time, but we also jumped over to Laos to see some less touristy spots! One of the highlights was visiting this amazing waterfall that never ended! it was similar to the water color of Havasupai. Who wouldn't like that blue color?
