Luke and I went on our first international trip together and it was incredible! We explored Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Kao Samaui, and Kao Phangan. We loved it all but we liked the northern region the most where the mountains surrounded us, the elepants, and the hippies! It was incredible to eat all of the authentic thai food every day and discovering our new favorite dish Khao Soi. To this day, I still try to recommend it to everyone!

One of our favorite nights was staying in this little shack for just $5 for both of us! it was the one night we got privacy along with the sound of a river flowing right outside. There were hammocks just outside for chillin during the sunset. The mango shakes were a must buy every few hours to stay hydrated and cool.
